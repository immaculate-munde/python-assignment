# File Handling & Exception Handling Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains Python programs to practice **file handling** and **exception handling**. The project demonstrates reading, writing, modifying files, and handling errors gracefully.

## Files
- `file_read_write.py`  
  Reads a file (`input.txt`), modifies its content (adds line numbers), and writes to `output.txt`.
  
- `error_handling_lab.py`  
  Prompts the user to enter a filename and handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

- `input.txt`  
  Sample input file used for testing.

- `output.txt`  
  Output file generated after running `file_read_write.py`.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Run the file read/write program:
```bash
python file_read_write.py
